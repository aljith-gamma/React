1, What is hooks in react?
A, In React, a hook is a function that lets you use state and other React features inside functional components. 
   With hooks, you can manage component state, perform side effects, and reuse stateful logic across multiple
   components. Think of hooks as a way to "hook into" React's internal processes and add functionality to 
   your components without needing to write class-based components.

2, What is useState ?
A, useState is a built-in hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components. With useState, 
   you can declare a state variable and set its initial value, and then update it using a function provided 
   by useState. When the state changes, React will re-render the component and update any parts of the UI 
   that depend on the state. Essentially, useState is a way to manage state in a simpler and more intuitive 
   way in functional components.

3, What is two way binding? 
A, Two-way binding is a data binding technique in which changes to a data model are automatically reflected 
   in the user interface (UI), and vice versa. In simpler terms, when two-way binding is used, any changes 
   made to the data are automatically updated in the UI, and any changes made in the UI are automatically 
   reflected back in the data. This technique is commonly used in front-end frameworks like Angular and Vue 
   to create dynamic, reactive applications.
