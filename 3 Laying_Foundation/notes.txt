1,  What is polyfil?
A,  It is basically a code which is a replacement for a newer version of code

    Polyfill is a piece of code that enables a web developer to use modern web technologies on older web 
    browsers that do not support those technologies. It essentially "fills in" the gaps and allows websites 
    to function properly for all users, regardless of their browser or device.

2,  What is babel?
A,  Babel is a tool that allows developers to write modern JavaScript code using the latest language features,
    while still ensuring that the code can run on older browsers and environments that don't support those 
    features. It does this by transforming the modern code into a backwards-compatible version that can be 
    run in a wide range of environments. This makes it easier for developers to write code that works for 
    all users, regardless of their browser or device.

3,  How can we build a perfomant web scalable app?
A,  To build a performant and scalable web application using React and bundlers, you should follow a few 
    best practices. Firstly, use a bundler such as Webpack or Rollup to efficiently bundle and optimize your 
    code. This includes using features such as tree shaking and code splitting to reduce the overall bundle 
    size and improve load times. Secondly, use a state management library such as Redux or MobX to manage 
    the state of your application in a scalable way. This allows you to manage complex state across multiple 
    components without impacting performance. Thirdly, optimize your components by using pure components, 
    memoization, and React's built-in performance tools such as Profiler and shouldComponentUpdate. Finally, 
    implement server-side rendering and code splitting to improve the initial load time of your application 
    and improve SEO. By following these best practices, you can build a scalable and performant web 
    application using React and bundlers. 

4,  What is diffing algorithm?
A,  Diffing algorithm is a method of comparing two sets of data or files and identifying the differences 
    between them. It is commonly used in software development, where developers need to track changes made 
    to source code or files. The algorithm analyzes the contents of both sets and generates a report 
    detailing the differences found, including added, removed, or modified content. This allows developers 
    to easily identify changes between versions of a file or codebase and make informed decisions on how to
    proceed with their work. In simpler terms, diffing algorithm helps to compare two things and highlight 
    what has changed between them.

5,  What is JSX ( JavaScript XML ) ?
A,  JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their 
    JavaScript code. It is commonly used with the React library for building user interfaces. With JSX, 
    developers can write code that looks like HTML, but actually describes the structure and behavior of UI 
    components. The syntax is then transformed into regular JavaScript by a compiler before it is executed 
    in the browser. In simpler terms, JSX is a way to write JavaScript code that looks like HTML, making it 
    easier to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

    JSX is a HTML like syntax, it is not HTML inside JavaScript

6,  What are the difference between HTML and JSX ?
A,  HTML and JSX are both used to define the structure of user interfaces, but there are some key differences
    between the two. HTML is a markup language used to describe the content and structure of web pages, 
    while JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within 
    their JavaScript code.

    One major difference is that HTML is static, meaning that the structure of the page is defined and 
    doesn't change unless the page is reloaded. JSX, on the other hand, is dynamic and can be updated in 
    real-time based on user interaction or changes in data.

    Another difference is that HTML uses attributes to define properties of elements, while JSX uses props, 
    short for properties, to pass data to components. This makes it easier to create reusable components and 
    to dynamically update the content of the page.

    In summary, while both HTML and JSX are used to define user interfaces, JSX is a more dynamic and flexible
    tool that allows developers to create reusable and interactive components within their JavaScript code.

7,  What are the advantages of JSX ?
A,  * Readability
    * Maintainability
    * Syntacical sugar for React.createElement
    * Lot more optimization things
